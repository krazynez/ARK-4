# ARK-4 e/CFW for the PSP and PS Vita.

New, updated, improved and modern `CFW` for `PSP` and `Vita`'s `ePSP`.
Simple to use and full of unique features, `ARK CFW` aims at keeping the `PSP` experience fresh. Being a successor to `PRO` and `ME`,
`ARK` is now the most feature-complete `CFW` for the `PSP`, having all features from classic `CFW`

- Built-in `No-DRM` engine `Stargate`. Compatible with `npdrm_free` by qwikrazor87.

## INSTALLATION

- Download the precompiled binaries from: https://github.com/PSP-Archive/ARK-4/releases/latest


<details>
  <summary> <b> Compiling ARK ( For Developers ) </b> </summary>
<p>

    Build script will allow you to use the correct SDK that ARK was built with.

- Release: `./build.sh` 
- Debug: `./build.sh --debug`
- Manually: install the oldest possible SDK (ideally the one used to compile M33), then run `make`

Use `-h` or `--help` to show all available flags 

</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <b> On PSP </b> </summary>
<p>

- Install `ARK_01234` folder into `/PSP/SAVEDATA/` folder.
- Install `ARK_Live` folder into `/PSP/GAME/` folder.
- Launch ARK Live Loader. It will install ARK modules on PSP Flash and boot the CFW.
- To use `Infinity` place the `EBOOT.PBP` (or `EBOOT_GO.PBP` renamed to `EBOOT.PBP` if using a PSP Go) from the `Infinity` folder found in the ARK download into `/PSP/GAME/UPDATE`. \
  Install `Infinity` using Official Firmware, run ARK from Live Loader, and then run `Infinity` again to configure autoboot. \
  This will allow you to use ARK permanently and triple boot with PRO and ME.
- You can also use the `cIPL` installer for a faster permanent CFW on 1K and early 2K models (models compatible with Pandora).
- If you will be using the Live loader version of ARK instead of a permanent solution, it is recommended that you delete `FLASH0.ARK` from the savedata file after the first installation and bootup of ARK, otherwise the flash0 files will be installed every time you boot back to ARK and this is detrimental to the flash even if ARK installs very little and small files. Doing this will also make the Live loader boot up ARK faster.
- To `update ARK` simply copy over the new `ARK_01234` savedata folder and run `ARK Loader` from `OFW`.

<details>
  <summary> <b> On PS Vita </b> </summary>
<p>

  - Works on 3.60 up to 3.74, either with or without Henkaku/h-encore.
  - Download a legit `PSP` game from `PSN`, the free demo of `Ape Quest` or `LocoRoco Midnight Carnival` is recommended. `Minis` are `NOT` recommended.
  - For Henkaku/h-encore users, install an ARK bubble using FastARK: https://github.com/theheroGAC/ArkFast/
  - Official Firmware users (no henkaku/h-encore) can install the PBOOT bubble manually: https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/Trinity#preparation
  - Replace the ARK savedata folder (`ux0:pspemu/PSP/SAVEDATA/ARK_01234`) with the folder from latest release.
  - Copy `K.BIN` from VitaBubble folder into `ARK_01234` savedata folder.
  - To use right analog stick (i.e. gta_remastered plugin): https://github.com/rereprep/ArkRightAnalog
  - To `exit` from a game or homebrew back to the `custom launcher`, press `L+R+Down+Start`. Works on `PSP` too.
  - Some features are not available to Vita users, mainly the official Sony `XMB` and `PS1` games.

<details>
  <summary> <b> Legacy Game Exploits (PSP & Vita) </b> </summary>
<p>

- Considering the savedata exploit loads H.BIN from the savedata path.
- Copy the following files from ARK_01234 savedata folder into game exploit folder:
- H.BIN, ARK.BIN, ARK4.BIN FLASH0.ARK, VBOOT.PBP, RECOVERY.PBP, THEME.ARK and other extras.
- You need to have a `K.BIN` if you are running on an ancient Vita firmware (there's plenty of kernel exploit sources in ARK-2 and ARK-3 for reference).

## CUSTOMIZATION

<details>
  <summary> <b> Installing Plug-Ins </b> </summary>
<p>
You can install plugins by creating a file called PLUGINS.TXT in the /SEPLUGINS/ folder and/or ARK's savedata folder.

To install plugins use the comma-separated format (CSV).
Where the header is: runlevel, path, switch.
A few samples:
- game, ms0:/seplugins/cwcheat/cwcheat.prx, enabled
- pops, ms0:/seplugins/cdda_enabler.prx, 1
- vsh, ms0:/seplugins/cxmb.prx, true
- ULUS10041, ms0:/seplugins/lcscheatdevice.prx, on

You can use the following keywords to enable a plugin:
- 1
- on
- true
- enabled
- Anything else disables the plugin

You can use the following keywords to tell ARK when the plugin loads:
- `all/always`: if either of these keywords are used, the plugin will always load.
- `umd`: plugin should only load on retail games (UMD/ISO/PSN).
- `homebrew`: plugin should only load on homebrews.
- `game`: plugin can load on both retail games and homebrews.
- `pops`: plugin only loads in PSX games.
- `vsh`: plugin only loads in the XMB.
- `launcher`: use this if the plugin should only load in the custom launcher.
- `game ID`: if you specify a game ID (i.e. `SLUS000000`), then the plugin will only load on that game.

You can also disable a plugin on certain games where they might be problematic.
To do so, just add a disable line for the specific game ID after the enable line.
For example, enable cwcheat on all retail games except for GTA LCS and VCS.
- umd, ms0:/seplugins/cwcheat/cwcheat.prx, on
- ULUS10041, ms0:/seplugins/cwcheat/cwcheat.prx, off
- ULES00502, ms0:/seplugins/cwcheat/cwcheat.prx, off

Some noteworthy plugins that are compatible with ARK include (but not limited to):
- CXMB.
- Leda.
- PopsLoader V3 and V4i.
- Custom Firmware Extender.
- PSPLink.
- GTA LCS and VCS cheadevice (including the remastered version).
- CWCheat.
- pspstates kai.

</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <b> Configuration and Settings </b> </summary>
<p>

You can create a SETTINGS.TXT file using the same format as PLUGINS.TXT to enable/disable some CFW functionality on different parts of the system.
Configuration settings you can use in ARK include:

- `overclock`: use this for better performance at the expense of battery time. Sets CPU/BUS speed to 333/166.
- `powersave`: use this for better battery life at the expense of performance. Sets CPU/BUS speed to 133/66.
- `usbcharge`: enables USB charging wherever you want.
- `launcher`: replaces the XMB with a custom menu launcher.
- `disablepause`: disables the pause game feature on PSP Go.
- `highmem`: enables high memory on models above 1K.
 You should only use this on homebrew runlevel as retail games were not meant to use the extra memory,
 and this can cause issues with cheat devices or other plugins that expect games to have their data at specific memory addresses.
 - `infernocache`: enables cache for Inferno driver, improving performance of some games.
 - `oldplugin`: enables old plugins support on PSP Go (redirects `ms0` to `ef0`).
 - `skiplogos`: skips the coldboot and gameboot logos.

However, you should use the `recovery menu` to handle settings easier.

You can use the same runlevels as used in plugins to tell ARK when the settings take effect (all/always, umd, homebrew, game, pops, vsh).

For example, you can overclock to highest CPU speed like this:
- always, overclock, on

Another example, overclock only on games, use powersaving on VSH:
- game, overclock, on
- vsh, powersave, on

  <summary> <b> Custom Launcher </b> </summary>
<p>
ARK comes prepacked with a very powerful launcher with a built-in file browser and highly customizable. You can however change it to whatever you please. You can change the theme used by both the custom launcher and recovery menu by replacing THEME.ARK with your own.


Aside from the default launcher provided, there have been many  other custom launchers created by scene members, some better looking, some with more features, some more simpler, but all of them with personality, dedication and love from the community. Here is a list of all popular menus for ARK:

  <summary> <b> Warnings </b> </summary>
<p>

- ARK comes with no warranty whatsoever. It was designed to be noob-proof, however it is possible for the universe to create an even greater noob capable of using ARK to destroy the Earth (or his PSP). I cannot be held responsible for this.

- ARK may cause ejectile malfunction if your hard drive is not hard enough.

- If this software malfunctions, you can turn it off and on again.
